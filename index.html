        My Favorite hobby is to write books. I love to write horror books because I like to make up staories then share them to people I know. My dream is to one publish my very own book. Writing makes me become more creative. I can easily think of a topic and then in an instant come up with the entire plot line in my head. I don't know how it happens but an entire story can come to me so quickly. Along the way while I write I might change up the story just a little bit when an idea comes that can be useful for writing the story. I sometimes use what I hear around me as a part of my stories. Then I write for a long time sometimes I stop writing to think ahead for the next chapter if I should add anything.Then when I finish my book all the work pays off and I feel like i've accomplished a amazing goal.
